### Development Log Summary - Tauri Application with SQLite

#### Objective:
Tauri application with NextJS frontend and SQLite storage.

#### Tasks Completed:

1. **Initial Project Setup**:
   - Initialized Tauri from Getting Started
   - Initialized the project frontend using Next.js.
  
2. **App Idea**:
   - Came up with idea for app based on how I would use it to store information I get from Canvas
  
3. **Generated Initial UI with Vercel's v0**
   https://v0.dev/r/jdeq5tPjDqz
   - Night theme still saved on there...

4. **Integration of `tauri-plugin-sql` with Tauri Application**:
   - Discussed the non-necessity of having SQLite platform installed locally as SQLite is embedded in the application.

5. **Creation and Testing of a Simple Database**:
   - Created a basic SQLite database within a Next.js-Tauri application.
   - UseEffect required for client side rendering

6. **Handling SSR in Next.js with Tauri**:
   - Addressed challenges related to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js when using Tauri. 
   - Recommended using dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) with `{ ssr: false }` to ensure client-side execution of database interactions in a parent SSR component.

7. **Idea for Custom Application Header Bar for Tauri App**:
   - Guided on creating a custom application header bar in Tauri, including design tips and window control using Tauri's API.
   - Not implemented

8. **Troubleshooting Database Errors**:
   - Resolved the query`"invalid args 'db' for command 'execute'"` error by discussing the correct use of the database identifier in Tauri SQL commands.
   - Addressed the `"UNIQUE constraint failed"` error by modifying the INSERT operation to handle unique ID values correctly.
   - Tackled the `"TypeError: db.query is not a function"` issue, suggesting the use of the appropriate method for executing SELECT queries in Tauri which is execute

9.  **Accessing SQLite Database with GUI Tools**:
   - Chose DB Browser for SQLite for GUI development of SQLite DB
   - Discovered local location in ~/Library/Application Support/com.tauri.dev/test.db
