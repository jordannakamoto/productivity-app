   
#### Objective:
Complete the API and test rendering Assignment list

#### Tasks Completed:

1. ** Finished API **
   - db/api/assignment
   - Issue came up with the database connection instance being returned as a promise because of a top level await function. Had to move the db connection into each of the api methods instead of a top-level call - I think this may be the only way to handle this.
2. ** Created and Implemented UI for @/components/assignemntsPage/grouped/assignments.client.jsx **
   - Loads all assignments records from db
   - Creates React UI component to display assignment
3. ** Created Editable Text area **
    - Provides functionality of being able to double click on an HTML div to convert it to a textarea for editing and updating the database record for the corrresponding assignment field
   -  ISSUE: textarea has some treatment by the browser or some auto assigned css (although I couldn't locate any discrepancy in the css) whereby the height of the textarea appears to grow despite having the same css style as the div that precedes its place. FIXED by 'display: flex'
4. ** CMD + Click enables Edit mode **
   - Buggy behavior with current implementation
   - Solution: Revert card element to div but have a moused over card switch to editable textareas on cmd key held.

#### TODO
1. **Create keyboard shortcut CMD + N to create a new assignment**
2. **Create AI API for parsing interactions**
3. **Connect WebVoice API to process voice input**
